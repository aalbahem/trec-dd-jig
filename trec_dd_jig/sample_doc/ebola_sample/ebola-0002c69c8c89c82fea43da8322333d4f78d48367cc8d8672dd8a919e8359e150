<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/physicians-prayers-their-patients-during-surgery/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/physicians-prayers-their-patients-during-surgery/#commentsMon, 05 Jan 2015 22:30:23 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=925As a physician I am often reminded of two things for which I am grateful. First, the great honor it is to care for people who are in a time of great need in their lives. Second, the many mentors in my life who have patiently taught and trained me in the arts of medicine.<p>Recently, I have thought a lot about one mentor, the late <a href="http://www.hirschesmiles.org/history/">Dr. Blayne Hirsche</a>. Dr. Hirsche was a gifted plastic and hand surgeon. He trained in surgery at Harvard and the Mayo Clinic. He founded the <a href="http://www.hirschesmiles.org/">Hirsche Smiles</a> foundation, which has performed thousands of reconstructive surgeries on children in Mexico and Guatemala. His legacy of compassionate care and service lives on through this foundation.</p>
<h2>A Young Surgeon’s Prayer</h2>
<p>Before medical school, I had the pleasure of working with Hirsche to gain experience as he performed surgeries. I cannot recall the details of why, but one day we talked about lessons he had learned during his training. One story he told has stuck with me ever since. He talked about a difficult surgery he was performing as a resident physician at Harvard. The head surgeon was world-renowned for the procedure being performed. Unfortunately, severe abdominal bleeding complicated the surgery.</p>
<p>At one point, it became apparent to Hirsche that the patient was going to bleed to death. Blood would rapidly fill the open abdomen as quickly as the surgical team could evacuate it, making it impossible for them to find the bleeding source. Suddenly the room became quiet and all eyes were directed toward the lead surgeon, who had stopped talking and working. A few moments later the surgeon reached into the abdomen and the bleeding stopped. His fingers had found the bleeding source, and with pressure the bleeding stopped. With the bleeding source identified, the surgeons quickly sutured the area, and the patient lived.</p>
<p>After the surgery, Hirsche asked the lead surgeon what had happened and why had he stopped. The lead surgeon said he stopped when he realized they were going to lose the patient, and he prayed for help. The surgeon did not say anything more. This was a profound experience for Hirsche as this surgeon was not known as a spiritual person. In fact, this was the one and only spiritual statement this surgeon ever made to Hirsche.</p>
<h2>A Young Mother’s Difficult Heart Procedure</h2>
<p>Most physicians are very aware of the limitations of medicine and medical procedures. Despite our best intentions, we often lose the battle to diseases. Every patient is unique, and even routine procedures can be challenging. All physicians who treat life-threatening diseases and have been in situations where they know they’re doing all they can for a patient and yet the patient’s life is slowly slipping away.</p>
<p>Hirsche shared his story with me nearly 20 years ago. His message found its way into my practice recently. A young mother of four children came to the hospital in <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/my-health-story/my-two-year-old-learned-how-to-dial-911-after-heart-failure-a-mothers-rebirth/">severe heart failure</a>. Four weeks earlier she had delivered a healthy baby. Now her heart was failing as 90 percent of the pumping function was no longer working.</p>
<p>As her heart failed, her lower heart chambers dilated and stretched, causing abnormally fast heart rhythms to develop. This further worsened her heart failure. Strong intravenous medications were started to support her blood pressure and fight impending kidney and respiratory failure. Despite our strongest intravenous medications to make the heart beat normally, as well as multiple electrical shocks to her heart, her <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/ways-your-heart-can-get-out-of-rhythm/">abnormal heart rhythms</a> continued.</p>
<p>It was clear she was close to dying, but we had a few options. One was to replace the heart with an artificial heart until she could get <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/questions-ask-your-doctor-about-heart-transplant/">a heart transplant</a>. Another option was to do open heart surgery to place heart pumps, called ventricular assist devices, to support her failing heart. The third was to go into her heart through her blood vessels, find the source of the abnormal heart rhythm, and destroy it. This could allow the heart to slow down and hopefully recover. Due to potential challenges with placing a heart pump, the third option was felt to be the best. For that reason, I became involved.</p>
<h2>A Simple Plea for Help</h2>
<p>When she arrived in our cardiac catheterization room, she was placed on a breathing machine. The room buzzed with physicians specializing in high-risk anesthesia, critical-care medicine, heart failure, and surgery. The cardiac surgery team was on standby to perform an emergency procedure, if needed, to transition her to a transplant. As we prepared for the cath procedure, her blood pressure continued to fall, requiring more medications to support it. Her blood oxygen level also started to fall, despite respiratory support. I quickly gained access to her blood vessels. In the setting of severe heart failure, these <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/what-questions-should-i-ask-before-my-atrial-fibrillation-ablation/">ablation procedures</a> to treat abnormal heart rhythms often take four to six hours. I knew she didn’t have that much time.</p>
<p>Before I advanced the tool into her heart, I prayed silently. My prayers are not graceful and eloquent. I would characterize them as a simple plea for help. A few seconds after my prayer, I advanced a tool into her heart to the area I thought was most likely causing the abnormal rhythm. As the tool touched this area, the abnormal heart rhythm stopped. We delivered heat energy to the site to destroy the short circuit. Her blood pressure and blood oxygen began to rise. And her heart rate — once at 150 to 160 beats per minute — now beat normally at 100 beats per minute.</p>
<p>I have treated hundreds of these abnormal heart rhythms, but I have never seen such a quick response. Within five minutes of starting the procedure, her heart was normal. That night I was able to talk with her. She held my hand and said “Thank you.” There was not a lot more to say. It was humbling for me because I realized that a few hours earlier we both had pleaded for help. I am happy to report she is on her way to recovery. Her heart is getting stronger each day.</p>
<h2>Faith and Hope Among Physicians</h2>
<p>I have had many mentors who draw great strength from spiritual sources. Some have been Christians like me, while others were Jewish, Hindus, Buddhists, and Muslims. That is one of the great aspects of medicine: A tremendous diversity of backgrounds come together for a common goal. I have heard some people say that physician spirituality is a sign of weakness, but I have found the opposite to be true. These mentors of mine are world leaders in their fields and draw from all means to treat and care for people in a field that does not have all the answers. They use their faith to find inner strength and peace. To a believer of spiritual things these stories can make believing easier.</p>
<p>It is harder when prayers and best intentions fail. Believers will often say that when this occurs it is part of a greater plan or design. To a nonbeliever of spiritual things, perceived failures make it easier not to believe.</p>
<p>I am grateful for my patients who have told me that they, their family, or pastor have prayed for me and they believe everything will be all right. These gestures are filled with great faith and hope. Hope and optimism, regardless of belief, are associated with better outcomes and longevity. I once had a Catholic patient who came in for a very small routine procedure. He also took my hand and said, “It will be alright, I had my last rites read to me.” I am not sure if that was a vote of confidence. I told him thank you, but I was not planning on letting him die just yet.</p>
<p>I have a close friend who is an atheist. He told me one day, “You know all of this is not going to matter in the end, as we all die and aren’t coming back.”</p>
<p>I told him that is what makes it even more meaningful. Because when we do die, it is important to have hope in a better tomorrow.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/physicians-prayers-their-patients-during-surgery/feed/0<title>A Tomato a Day Keeps the Heart Doctor Away</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/tomato-day-keeps-heart-doctor-away/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/tomato-day-keeps-heart-doctor-away/#commentsFri, 19 Dec 2014 06:55:50 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=900Most people have heard the advice, “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” This bit of advice is over a century old. The first version recorded was in the 1866 edition of Notes and Queries which states, “Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread.” In general, <a href="https://www.my-calorie-counter.com/">substituting a fiber-rich apple</a> for high calorie foods, sweets, or processed products with high-fructose corn syrup is a great idea. Apples are also good sources of vitamin C, they clean our teeth, help with colon health, and they may help lower risk of dementia. However, even if you eat an apple daily, it is still a good idea to see your primary care doctor for regular check ups.<h2>Tomatoes for Heart Health</h2>
<p>I want to propose a new twist on the age-old advice. Rather than an apple, let’s use a tomato. Rather than a general doctor, let’s substitute a heart doctor. Maybe all along the advice should have been, “A tomato a day keeps the heart doctor away.”</p>
<p>You may be asking, why a tomato? Tomatoes are a very nutritional food source rich in anti-oxidants, vitamin A and C, <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/surprising-health-benefits-b-vitamins/">folic acid </a>and beta-carotene. They are also rich in a substance called lycopene. Lycopene is a bright red carotene that gives tomatoes their color. Lycopene can also be found in other fruits and vegetables such as watermelon or red carrots. In an average diet, tomatoes account for more than two-thirds of your lycopene consumption.</p>
<h2>Evidence From Studies of Tomato and Lycopene</h2>
<p>It may surprise you, but because of lycopene there are many studies that have tested the role of tomato consumption on heart health and heart disease risk factors. Here is a breakdown of what we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Oxidized LDL.</strong> LDL is the bad part of our cholesterol. When it becomes “oxidized” due to a process called oxidative stress, oxidized LDL leads to cholesterol accumulation that forms plaques in the arteries of our bodies, in particular the coronary arteries. These plaques can rupture and cause a heart attack. In studies of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229363">healthy people</a>, as well as those with <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10840987">type 2 diabetes</a>, consumption of tomatoes or tomato products <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16368299">decreased levels of oxidized LDL</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Body Inflammation.</strong> Markers of inflammation in our body have been shown to be associated with risk of heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and atrial fibrillation. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23069270">Tomato consumption</a> has been shown to reduce some of these markers of inflammation suggesting an improvement in inflammatory status particularly in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22819555">overweight and obese people</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Blood Pressure.</strong> In patients with pre-high blood pressure (prehypertension) or <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10839209">hypertension</a>, tomato and tomato product consumption has a modest lowering effect on both <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21138408">systolic and diastolic blood pressure</a>. This can be seen as early as 8 weeks after starting frequent consumption.</li>
<li>
<strong>Potential benefit after a heart attack.</strong> In two animal studies, rats were either treated with lycopene or a placebo for 30 days. After 30 days, a heart attack was caused in all the rats. Those <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060410">rats treated with lycopene</a> had a better blood pressure and less heart tissue/cell loss if they had <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609310/">received lycopene</a>. These interesting findings need to be studied in humans to see if our bodies and hearts respond in a similar manner.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved survival in patients with heart failure.</strong> In a <a href="Higher%20dietary%20lycopene%20intake%20is%20associated%20with%20longer%20cardiac%20event-free%20survival%20in%20patients%20with%20heart%20failure.%20">study of 212 patients with heart failure</a>, higher lycopene intake from tomatoes was associated with improved survival. In fact, patients with low lycopene intake were 3.3 times more likely to die compared to those with high lycopene intake.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reduced risk of stroke.</strong> In a study of 1,031 men from Finland, <a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/79/15/1540">high lycopene consumption</a> from tomatoes was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke compared to men with a low consumption. In this study, stroke risk was reduced by 65 percent with high lycopene consumption.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, these studies suggest that the tomato is a great healthy choice for our hearts and may as part of a <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/our-instincts-exercise-heart-disease-can-be-dead-wrong/">healthy lifestyle</a> reduce risk of heart disease. Some of these studies show the greatest benefit after early disease has developed, so it is never too late to make these lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>I am often asked if a supplement is as good as the food source. Or in other words, is a lycopene pill a good substitute for eating the tomato itself? Although there is evidence to support lycopene supplements for heart health, when all the <a href="http://advances.nutrition.org/content/5/5/457.abstract">evidence is examined</a> eating a tomato is the better choice.</p>
<p>So, when planning your diet, remember a tomato a day just may keep the heart doctor away.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/tomato-day-keeps-heart-doctor-away/feed/0<title>If You Don’t Snooze, Your Heart Loses</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/if-you-dont-snooze-your-heart-loses/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/if-you-dont-snooze-your-heart-loses/#commentsFri, 05 Dec 2014 22:35:00 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=882I have written a number of <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/low-fat-low-carbohydrate-whats-best-for-your-heart/">columns on diet</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/how-remain-young-heart-maintain-low-blood-pressure/">exercise</a>, but devote this one to the true first step in improving your heart health: Get more and better sleep.<p>I’ll share a common example of a person who was sacrificing sleep, and possibly his heart health, for other goals. While I was at the Mayo Clinic I had the opportunity to work and train in the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/executive-health-program/overview">Executive Health Program</a>. This is an innovative clinic designed to meet the needs of very busy individuals who often do not have a lot of time to devote to their health. In cardiology at Mayo Clinic we often dealt with two specific aims of this program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heart (cardiovascular) fitness evaluation</li>
<li>Lifestyle assessment, including a review of nutrition, stress management, <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/research-shows-alcohol-increases-atrial-fibrillation-risk/">alcohol</a>, tobacco, and other indicators of disease</li>
</ol>
<p>I had the opportunity to meet remarkable people who held leadership positions at some of the most innovative and successful businesses in the world. These were often people with extraordinary drive and passion for their work. A very common theme among these people was that they sacrificed their health and personal interests for sake of company or business success.</p>
<p>A 55-year-old male came in for a general check-up. He was the chief executive officer (CEO) of a technology company that was in the process of going public to raise more capital for the company. He traveled at least four times a week. He slept three to five hours a night on what he called a “good day.” With a packed daily schedule he was unable to exercise routinely. He seldom ate meals at home.</p>
<p>As a consequence he had gained 20 to 30 pounds since his college days, and had started on medications to <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/my-experience-with-atrial-fibrillation-high-blood-pressure/">treat high blood pressure</a> and high cholesterol. After outlining this lifestyle to us, he said, “I plan to cut back and take care of myself once the company goes public. I am hoping that this will occur in the next few years.”</p>
<p>This example may seem extreme, but unfortunately it was a very common story that we encountered in the Executive Health Program.</p>
<h2>Why Your Heart Needs Good Sleep</h2>
<p>Often, as physicians, we focus on high blood pressure <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/how-follow-low-cholesterol-diet/">and high cholesterol</a>. We make sure no bad habits have emerged, such as smoking or alcohol abuse. However, we often do not focus on the time and quality of sleep.</p>
<p>Yet sleep quality and heart disease are very closely linked. When you sleep, your heart rate slows and your blood pressure drops. This takes workload off the heart that, as a muscle, must recover while on the move. For about 25 percent of us, our heart rate will slow to 35 to 45 beats per minute during deep sleep.</p>
<p>A study published just this month really brings home the message about the link between <a href="http://jaha.ahajournals.org/content/3/6/e001454.short">sleep duration and heart disease risk</a>. The study involved 7,690 men and women with no history of heart disease or stroke. The authors looked at their 10-year risk of heart disease. Among the study participants, most slept between 6 and 8 hours. Here are the detailed results:</p>
<ul>
<li>13 percent reported sleeping 5 hours or less</li>
<li>24 percent reported sleeping 6 hours</li>
<li>32 percent reported sleeping 7 hours</li>
<li>25 percent reported sleeping 8 hours</li>
<li>4.0 percent reported sleeping 9 hours</li>
<li>Only about 1 percent reported sleeping more than 10 hours</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Much Sleep Is Enough for Your Heart?</h2>
<p>After accounting for all medical problems, diet and exercise the authors concluded the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For women, sleeping 6 hours or less a night increased risk of heart disease by 13 percent to 23 percent over 10 years.</li>
<li>For men, sleeping 6 hours or less a night increased risk of heart disease by up to 10 percent over 10 years.</li>
<li>In both men and women, sleeping more than 10 hours a day increased heart risk by 20 percent over 10 years. (Too much of a good thing is not necessarily a good thing.)</li>
<li>In both men and women, the lowest heart disease risk was in those who routinely got 7 hours of sleep a night.</li>
</ul>
<p>Returning to my CEO patient: By neglecting sleep he was increasing his risk of heart disease by about 10 percent. How does this risk compare to his other problems? You can do this for yourself using an <a href="http://cvdrisk.nhlbi.nih.gov/evalData.asp">online 10-year heart-disease risk calculator</a>. For high blood pressure alone, if he uses his medication his risk of heart disease is 7 percent at 10 years. For high cholesterol, depending on the level, the risk of heart disease can be 7 percent to 15 percent. In reality, his sleep problems are potentially as harmful to his heart health as his high blood pressure and cholesterol.</p>
<h2>How to Get Better Quality Sleep</h2>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips">excellent sleep resource from Harvard Medical School</a>, with their 12 simple steps to better sleep and why they matter:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and other chemicals that interfere with your sleep. </b><a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health-pictures/this-is-your-heart-on-energy-drinks.aspx">Caffeine </a>and alcohol are the big offenders here. Caffeine should be used only early in the day. In some people, alcohol may result in getting to sleep quicker, but sleep quality is reduced.<b></b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Turn your bedroom into a sleep-inducing environment. </b>Use your bedroom for sleep. Remove unnecessarily noises and lights. Keep your bedroom at a temperature that is good for sleeping: 60-75 degrees F. Remove work materials, and if your pet awakens you, move the pet to outside of the room.</li>
<li>
<b>Establish a soothing pre-sleep routine. </b>Before you go to bed, try to relax your body. For some people this may be yoga. For others it may be a hobby to take their mind off of work or daily stresses. You may find peace in<b> </b>meditation or prayer, taking a bath, or reading a book.</li>
<li>
<b>Go to sleep when you’re truly tired. </b>This gets into point #2 and using the bedroom to sleep. If you are anxious, stressed, angry, try something relaxing before going to bed. If you return to your room and those feelings return, after 20 minutes, get up and try another relaxing activity.</li>
<li>
<b>Don’t be a nighttime clock-watcher. </b>Watching the clock can be a great source of anxiety; particularly if you start to think your opportunity to sleep is slowly ticking away. In general, it is best to turn the clock face away from you and use your alarm to make sure you wake up on time.</li>
<li>
<b>Use light to your advantage. </b>This point is very important particularly for people who live at high altitudes or in cold climates. Make sure your room <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/why-weather-matters-when-youre-depressed/">gets plenty of sunlight</a> to help you awaken. In the day, spend time outside getting some sun exposure. This helps set your internal wake-sleep cycle, lowers depression, and improves vitamin D. Personally, this is one of the most important things I have found to improve my sleep and daily outlook.</li>
<li>
<b>Keep your internal clock set with a consistent sleep schedule. </b>Do your best to keep a sleep schedule. This will train your body. A runner does not run a marathon in a day; it takes weeks to months of training to get the body condition to perform as wanted. I have seen the ill effects in my clinic of people who unfortunately have a job that involves swing shifts and frequent disruptions in sleep.</li>
<li>
<b>Nap early—or not at all. </b>If you find you need many naps in the day, you may need to see your doctor to determine if you have something interrupting your sleep quality such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, medication side effects, etc.  However, a nap is a healthy life choice in many people. If you are refreshed by a daily nap, make sure to do it relatively early in the day and avoid napping within 8 hours of when you typically go to sleep.</li>
<li>
<b>Lighten up on evening meals. </b>This is sage advice not only for keeping your weight down, but also for improving your sleep. Avoid overeating, foods that can cause heart burn (fattening or spicy foods, mints, caffeinated food sources, etc), and any foods that make you feel bloated or distended.</li>
<li>
<b>Balance fluid intake. </b>Bathroom breaks in the middle of the night are a very common source of insomnia. You need to stay hydrated, but excessive drinking in the day can cause you to need to urinate at night. In this regard, remember that caffeine and alcohol are diuretics or in other words they make you lose water and increase urination frequency. Drink to the point that you are not thirsty when you way up. However do most of your drinking in the morning and early afternoon.</li>
<li>
<b>Exercise early. </b>Exercise actually will help you fall asleep quicker, sleep more restful, and extend your length of sleep. However, you don’t want to stimulate your body right before you sleep. Activities that are relaxing to the body are those that are best performed just before sleep.</li>
<li>
<b>Follow through. </b>This is a catchall recommendation. Many medical problems can impact sleep and may or may not respond to the recommendations listed. Clearly, if you have done all you can and sleep remains a challenge, see your physician. Disorders such as iron deficiency, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, restless leg syndromes, and medication side effects can all impact sleep in a negative manner. In some cases you may need to see a sleep specialist who has specific training to improve your sleep duration and quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sleep is essential for your heart health. Make sure you take time for yourself and get the sleep you need. Sometimes, waiting for the next task to be done puts you in an endless cycle of self-neglect that will ultimately cost  your health.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/if-you-dont-snooze-your-heart-loses/feed/0<title>Our Instincts on Exercise and Heart Disease Can Be Dead Wrong</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/our-instincts-exercise-heart-disease-can-be-dead-wrong/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/our-instincts-exercise-heart-disease-can-be-dead-wrong/#commentsWed, 19 Nov 2014 16:16:11 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=853I want to tell you the cautionary tale of the desert stink beetle:<p>One of the great aspects of living along the Rocky Mountains in Utah is the opportunity to enjoy the many mountainside trails. Early-morning runs are a solace to me in a time of everchanging medical professional demands and stresses. I have to watch my step over rocky terrain to keep from falling, but to also avoid a common trailside companion, the desert stink beetle or acrobat beetle. With a body that frow in excess of an inch long, this large, armored black beetle is no slouch in the beetle family.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-863" alt="Stink Beetle" src="http://Images.agoramedia.com/EHBlogImages/jared-bunch/2014/11/Stink-Beetle.jpg" width="324" height="243"></p>
<p><a href="http://Images.agoramedia.com/EHBlogImages/jared-bunch/2014/11/StinkBeetle.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-859" alt="StinkBeetle" src="http://Images.agoramedia.com/EHBlogImages/jared-bunch/2014/11/StinkBeetle.jpg" width="324" height="243"></a></p>
<p>Stink beetles are constantly crossing the trail looking for food. Most insects do all they can to get away from danger. But when faced with danger, this beetle stops and stands on its head. For the stink beetle, this is an effective strategy as they emit an odor that repels many would-be predators.</p>
<p>However, I run on trail shared by many runners and bikers. Each time a foot or tire is close, the beetle will stand on its head in definance of its much greater foe. Unfortunately, on a busy trail this is often the worst thing the beetle can do, and many meet an untimely ending to their morning.</p>
<p>What can be drawn from the fate of the desert stink beetle to help us understand and prevent heart disease?</p>
<p>First, the beetle is following its instincts and doing what is natural in the face of danger. Second, even when the perceived danger is over, the beetle will continue to hold the “standing on its head” position for minutes afterwards, exposing itself to another danger that may be coming along the trail.</p>
<p>I see this same pattern in patients who develop heart disease, in particular <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/is-it-harmful-to-delay-receiving-treatment-for-atrial-fibrillation/">atrial fibrillation</a>. Here are a few recent examples.</p>
<h2>The Instinct to Protect Your Heart by Resting</h2>
<p>I met a patient who developed atrial fibrillation in his early forties. He came to me because his atrial fibrillation was worsening, with episodes that were increasing in time and severity of symptoms.</p>
<p>As I do with all patients, I talked with him about the disease and risk factors for its development and progression. I asked him directly about his daily activity and exercise. He told me, “I was afraid to make my heart go fast, so I stopped exercising. Now my episodes of atrial fibrillation occur all the time without warning.”</p>
<p>He feared that a normal heart rhythm might lead to an abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation. I suspect that almost every physician who cares for people with atrial fibrillation has heard this answer. A person wants to protect their diseased heart and hopes to do so by not making it go fast.</p>
<p>A second example comes from a man in his mid-fifties. He had experienced a <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/fatal-heart-attacks-strike-firefighters-under-pressure/">heart attack</a> while working as a mechanic in his forties. Fortunately, it was treated early with insertion of a small stent in the blocked coronary artery.</p>
<p>He attributed the heart attack to his busy schedule. He quit his job. He stopped “pushing his heart” with long hikes in preparation for, and during, hunting season. He lost interest in exercise. What ensued was a 10-year progressive course of weight gain, diabetes, sleep apnea, and <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/easy-ways-to-take-your-blood-pressure/">high blood pressure</a>. When I saw him in my clinic he was experiencing chest pain while going up stairs. We performed a study called a coronary angiogram, in which dye is injected into the heart arteries to look for blockages. Unfortunately, in his case, the stent was now occluded — closed up — and there were new and progressive blockages in all of his main heart arteries. With the extent of his heart disease, an open-heart coronary bypass operation was required.</p>
<p>This man believed hard work had caused his first heart attack. He changed his lifestyle to remove all potential stresses from his heart. Unfortunately, his efforts made his heart disease worse, and he developed many other problems along the way.</p>
<p>These two patients’ stories have a strong correlation. Both men were following their instincts to protect their hearts. Neither man wanted to stress his heart and make his condition worse. However, in both cases, theri heart disease worsened.</p>
<h2>What You Really Need to Protect Your Heart: Exercise</h2>
<p>The truth is, our bodies perform much better, respond better to therapies, and recover quicker from illness when we’re active. Outside of some rare inherited heart conditions, severe narrowing of the heart valves, and advanced heart failure, the heart actually works better with daily moderate exercise — even if you already have heart disease.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how exercise can impact heart disease outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are worried about heart disease, recognize that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15166195">many studies have shown</a> that exercise helps. Exercise reduces body inflammation, cholesterol, blood pressure, and the risk of clot formation; it improves body weight and fat-to-muscle ratio; and reduces stroke and heart attack risk. You can see these benefits within four weeks of starting a program of jogging 2 miles a day or riding a bike for 45 minutes a day.</li>
<li>If you have atrial fibrillation, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24240932">research shows exercise and weight reduction</a> will lower the severity of your symptoms by up to 80 percent, and the duration of your atrial fibrillation episodes by up to 25 percent.</li>
<li>Three months of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23375926">yoga training can cut your episodes of atrial fibrillation</a> by up to 50 percent, reduce your feelings of depression and anxiety about atrial fibrillation, and improve your quality of life <span>overall </span>, a 2013 study showed.</li>
<li>People who were hospitalized for a heart attack, a coronary artery stent procedure, or coronary artery bypass surgery who later participated in a <a href="Cardiac%20rehabilitation%20and%20survival%20in%20older%20coronary%20patients.%20">cardiac rehabilitation procedure</a> reduced their risk of death, a large study showed (21 percent risk of death versus 34 percent for those who were not in cardiac rehab).</li>
<li>Many studies show exercise can lower risk of having a second heart attack, by 38 percent if you start shortly <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16263889">after your first heart attack</a>.</li>
<li>In people with heart failure, an <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19351941">exercise cardiac rehabilitation</a> program can your lower risk of cardiac death and hospitalization by 15 percent, researchers found.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have heart disease and are not exercising,  meet with your physician before starting to exercise to get a recommendation for an exercise prescription or a referral to a cardiac rehabilitation exercise program. These programs are great, and they often give people confidence in their body and heart after they have experienced a significant heart event such as a heart attack.</p>
<p>Realize that these studies that have shown benefit with exercise have been done in the young and old, women and men, and the benefits are seen broadly. I often tell my patients who have not exercised and want to start to do so using a “talk test.” If your are exercising and are so short of breath you cannot talk to a person next to you, you need to reduce your exercise level. Sometimes, exercise periods need to be brief at the start and may seem insignificant. But long-term, you should see gradual improvement, with the end goal of exercising 150 to 300 minutes per week (the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/index.html">U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention</a> exercise recommendation).</p>
<p>Don’t make the same mistake as the desert stink beetle. When it comes to your heart, your well-being, and your life, don’t stop and remained stubbornly fixed. Instead, become active and exercise. Even people who can only do low-level exercise because of of very poor health, fall risk, or frailty stilll benefit from activity.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/our-instincts-exercise-heart-disease-can-be-dead-wrong/feed/0<title>Deaths from Stroke Rise With Use of Certain Painkillers</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/deaths-from-stroke-rise-with-certain-pain-killers/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/deaths-from-stroke-rise-with-certain-pain-killers/#commentsThu, 06 Nov 2014 19:11:50 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=836I suspect in almost every household in America people have non-steroidal, anti-inflammmatory drugs (NSAIDs), sometimes used as painkillers. All NSAIDs have side effects, and new <a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2014/11/05/WNL.0000000000001024.abstract">research published in the journal Neurology</a> shows that increased risk of death from stroke comes along with certain of these drugs.<p>Many of these drugs are sold over the counter and can be purchased in pharmacies, grocery stores, and gas stations. The most common names are <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> and <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/naproxen">naproxen</a>, but when you take into account prescription formulations there are over 20 different types. They are also sold in combination with other medications used for sleep aids, migraine headaches, and cold and flu medications.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do NSAIDs Work?</strong></h2>
<p>NSAIDs block an enzyme in our body that is used to create inflammation called cyclooxygenase. When this enzyme is partially blocked, the body creates less inflammation. Hopefully, the body also experiences less pain.</p>
<p>The ways various NSAIDs block cyclooxygenase are different. Some block both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). These are called non-selective NSAIDs. Others only block COX-2, and are called selective. COX-1 is found throughout the body including the stomach, blood vessels, and part of the blood (platelets). COX-2 is more concentrated in areas of inflammation or injury. So there are potential advantages in just blocking COX-2 to reduce inflammation and hopefully experience fewer side effects.</p>
<p>An example of a COX-2 inhibitor is <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/celebrex">celecoxib (Celebrex)</a>. This is sometimes given to people who experience stomach pain with other NSAIDs or have a history of prior stomach bleeding or stomach ulcers.</p>
<p>NSAIDs side effects can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stomach pain and irritation</li>
<li>Kidney injury particularly when a person is dehydrated</li>
<li>Liver injury</li>
</ul>
<p>People who have a <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/social-support-eases-heart-disease-stroke-recovery/">history of a heart condition</a>, like coronary artery or multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease, may be at higher risk of a heart attack with NSAIDs use. In people with heart disease, chronic use of NSAIDs may increase risk of heart failure or worsening of heart failure. In people with <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/arthur-agatston-md-truth-about-cholesterol-3442.aspx">coronary artery disease</a> the risk of problems may be slightly less with naproxen, but there remains a slightly higher risk compared to people who don’t use NSAIDs.</p>
<h2>New NSAIDs Risks Discovered</h2>
<p>Some of the risk from NSAIDs use is because the drugs alter platelet function in the blood. Platelets are little particles in our blood that lump together to form a clot. If these platelets become stimulated they can form small clots in people at risk and this can lead to a heart attack. They can also become dysfunctional and increase bleeding risk. For this reason, NSAIDs are often held back before you have a surgery. The mechanisms of why they can make you at higher risk to experience both clots and bleeds are complex and vary from person to person.</p>
<p>When a small clot or bleed occurs in the brain <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/half-of-us-women-dont-know-signs-of-stroke-do-you/">it is called a stroke</a>. Depending on the size and location of the injury, symptoms can range from mild, to disabling, or even death. Given the effect of NSAIDs on clotting and bleeding it is reasonable to be concerned that these agents increase stroke risk. In fact, previous studies have shown the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21224324">use of some NSAIDS can nearly double the risk of stroke</a>. It is also possible since these agents alter platelet function they may increase the extent of the stroke and as such increase disability and death risk.</p>
<h2><strong>New Evidence of Stroke Risk With NSAID Use</strong></h2>
<p>A new study helped to determine if chronic NSAIDs use would increase stroke-related deaths. The authors particularly wanted to understand if COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs might have a lower risk. The study was a from Denmark and examined 100,043 patients over eight years.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of their findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who used COX-2 NSAIDs chronically were 19 percent more likely to die from a stroke related to a clot, compared to those who did not use the drugs.</li>
<li>Stroke-related deaths did not increase for patients using the nonselective type NSAIDs long-term, compared to nonusers.</li>
<li>New use of nonselective NSAIDs also did not increase risk of death from stroke within 30 days.</li>
<li>However, new use of COX-2 NSAIDs did increase risk of death from stroke by 20 percent in the first 30 days of use.</li>
<li>Of the agents available in the United States, new use of <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/celebrex">celecoxib (Celebrex)</a> was associated with a 12 percent increase in deaths from stroke within the first 30 days of use.</li>
<li>None of the NSAIDs increased risk of death from the type of stroke that is related to bleeding in the brain.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>When to Consider Other Options for Pain</strong></h2>
<p>The increased mortality after a stroke in patients using a COX-2 inhibitor NSAID was seen across all agents. This suggests that there is a drug-class effect. Fortunately, with newer agents, in particular the one available in the United States, the risk is less. Since the risk is primarily driven in patients that recently started these agents, care and consideration must be taken when considering using these agents for long-term pain treatment.</p>
<p>If you are at risk of stroke, or have experienced a prior stroke, consider other pain control options that do not have the increased risk of stroke death, such as acetaminophen.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been using a nonselective NSAID or a COX-2 inhibitor NSAID long-term, these results do not show an increased risk of death related to stroke or increased risk of death related to bleeding in the brain. I believe that is good news. However, there remains a generally recognized higher risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke so if alternative agents will work for you consider their use. These discussions regarding long-term use and alternative agents should be made with your physician.</p>
<p>With all medications there is a trade-off between risks and benefits. In my experience the NSAIDs drug class is by far the best medication to decrease pain from arthritis. In some people, if NSAIDs are stopped they become largely crippled and then suffer the ill effects of immobility. To them, the risks involved with using NSAIDs are far lower than the obtainable benefits derived from remaining active and mobile. In some patients, regularly dosed acetaminophen works to reduce pain enough to maintain their quality of life. In these patients the risk of chronic exposure to NSAIDs is greater than the benefit, since an alternative agent can be used.</p>
<p>This new study helps us further understand the risks associated with these drugs and will help you and your physician make decisions regarding how to best treat your pain long-term.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/deaths-from-stroke-rise-with-certain-pain-killers/feed/0<title>Ebola Versus Influenza: Both Can Kill, But One Has a Vaccine</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/ebola-versus-influenza-both-can-kill-but-one-has-vaccine/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/ebola-versus-influenza-both-can-kill-but-one-has-vaccine/#commentsMon, 27 Oct 2014 17:52:50 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=808Viruses can kill, but what about steps for prevention to protect your heart health?<p>You cannot read or listen to any news source today without hearing <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/ebola-10-essential-facts-about/">about the Ebola virus</a>. Ebola is a rare and sometimes deadly virus. It is a wicked virus and can cause multi-organ failure despite early treatment and support in advanced medical facilities. The virus is spread by direct contact with fluids from an infected person with symptoms. <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/ebola/map/">Ebola can be spread</a> by exposure to blood, saliva, sweat, urine, vomit, feces, breast milk, and semen. This virus is not spread through the air like influenza is, or in water.</p>
<p>As caring physicians, aid care workers, and nurses return from West Africa from serving Ebola-stricken regions, we have started to learn how to treat and manage the disease in the United States. Part of the reality of learning to <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/ebola/treatment/">treat Ebola virus</a> in the United States is that even when our trained healthcare professionals understand how the disease is transmitted and wear protective clothing, they have become infected with the disease. These are not incompetent people or hospitals; they manage infectious diseases all the time.</p>
<p>The problem is that many diseases are high contagious and only a small amount of bacteria or virus is required to infect another person.</p>
<h2>Airborne Infectious Diseases Are Difficult to Prevent</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the way <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/ebola/virus/">Ebola is transmitted</a> from one person to another has been relatively stable since discovery in 1979. By this I mean that it still takes direct contact with an infected symptomatic person or their body fluids. Some diseases don’t need direct contact. They can be spread more quickly to many people just by being in the same general area as an infected person. These diseases are the airborne diseases.</p>
<p>An example of airborne disease is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis at one time was the leading cause of death in the United States. It is transmitted directly from the lungs of an infected individual through breathing or coughing and into the lungs of a new person. It is still around.</p>
<p>Currently it is estimated that approximately one third of the world’s population has been exposed to tuberculosis, particularly in developing countries. We don’t hear as much about tuberculosis because of vaccination programs for children in developing countries and better treatments for active disease.</p>
<h2>Sinister Aspects of Influenza Virus</h2>
<p>At this point you are probably wondering what this infectious disease discussion has to do with heart disease.  I want to talk about another <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/">sinister virus called influenza</a>. Influenza is also an airborne disease and is transmitted when infected people sneeze, cough, or talk in the area of another person. The little infected airborne droplets can also land on surfaces and objects and when a person comes in contact with these objects with his hand and then touches his nose, mouth, or face he can become infected as well. Most of the time, symptoms of flu include a fever, cough, headache, body aches, sore throat, and a runny nose. But just like Ebola, influenza can be a wicked virus and cause multi-organ failure and death.</p>
<p>I have never cared for a person with Ebola, but I have cared for numerous people with influenza in the critical care units, on ventilators, and in some cases these patients have died. Now that we recognized how difficult it is to prevent Ebola that is spread by contact, you can imagine how difficult it is to truly prevent the spread of an airborne disease like influenza. Complicating the challenges with influenza is that the virus often mutates and future strains may be more powerful and lethal than any we have experienced or can imagine. That is an ominous thought when you consider influenza’s past.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Russian flu in 1890 killed approximately 1 million people.</li>
<li>The Spanish flu in 1918 killed up to 100 million people.</li>
<li>More recently in 2009, the H1N1 flu killed nearly 300,000 people.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preventing Severity of Flu With Influenza Vaccine</h2>
<p>If you have read my prior columns you will know that I believe the best way to <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/the-best-treatment-for-atrial-fibrillation-is-to-prevent-it/">tackle any disease is to prevent it</a>, if possible. Each year we have the opportunity to receive an <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/be-good-to-your-heart-get-flu-shot.aspx">influenza vaccination</a>. We need these each year because influenza tends to mutate into new strains. Sometimes the new mutations are beyond the available vaccination, but most of the time the vaccination works very well.</p>
<p>Here are facts reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about the influenza vaccine.</p>
<ol>
<li>Children who were vaccinated have a 74 percent reduction in risk of being admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for treatment of the illness.</li>
<li>In adults, vaccination is associated with a 71 percent reduction in flu-related hospitalization.</li>
<li>In pregnant women, vaccination reduces the risk of flu hospitalization to their infant by 91 percent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although these numbers are not 100 percent, they do demonstrate that the vaccination actually works as a means to prevent disease.</p>
<p>As a heart doctor, I find it particularly important to share with you that the virus can invade the heart itself. This can cause heart injury that can be progressive and fatal. Also, if you have had a heart attack, heart failure, or have other heart diseases you are often more susceptible to complications with influenza.</p>
<h2>What Do We Know About Influenza and the Heart?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Influenza has been shown to be a <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa041747">direct trigger for a heart attack</a> during the first three days of the flu infection.</li>
<li>Influenza has been shown to be a<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18728360"> trigger to acute ischemic stroke</a>, or in other words a stroke from a clot.</li>
<li>Influenza can cause <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/104/8/914.long">coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis)</a> and rupture of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18293142">coronary artery disease plaques</a>.</li>
<li>Influenza can cause a direct infection and inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) that can lead to heart failure and life threatening abnormal heart rhythms.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Can We Prevent Heart Problems With an Influenza Vaccine?</h2>
<p>The truth is we don’t know this answer completely. A meta-analysis gave us some insight. The study looked at 39 previously reported studies and the authors found that the flu <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19778762">vaccination was effective in lowering adverse cardiac events</a> and death by approximately 49 percent.</p>
<p>An additional study looked at 31,546 patients in 40 countries to further understand if <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/126/3/278.long">vaccination reduced heart disease</a>. The authors found that the influenza vaccination lowered risk of major adverse heart events such as stroke, heart attack, and heart-related death by 35 percent during the flu season. The authors did find that the heart-related benefit was dependent on how well the vaccination matched the seasonal flu virus strains.</p>
<p>Right now the best way we know to prevent influenza is to receive the vaccination. Don’t rely on others including the health care industry to minimize risk of disease transfer or reduce your risk of exposure. With airborne diseases, it is almost impossible. If you are concerned about safety of the influenza vaccination, please <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/general.htm">review the CDC website</a>.</p>
<p>Most people do very well with the vaccination and experience no or mild symptoms. Some people should not receive a vaccination, mainly those with a known allergy and those with an egg allergy. Fortunately, I have never cared for a patient with a severe reaction to the vaccination. Unfortunately, I have cared for numerous patients with influenza who were not vaccinated.</p>
<p>So as a cardiologist, for your heart health, I highly recommend you get yourself and your family vaccinated.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/ebola-versus-influenza-both-can-kill-but-one-has-vaccine/feed/0<title>Do Relationships With Our Parents in Affect Our Heart Disease Risk?</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/do-parental-relationships-childhood-affect-heart-disease-risk/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/do-parental-relationships-childhood-affect-heart-disease-risk/#commentsThu, 16 Oct 2014 18:50:25 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=786Recently my teenage daughter and I had a conflict regarding her roles within our family. I suspect many parents of teenagers have faced similar battles.<p>I said, “You need to clean your room and finish the dishes before your go out with your friends.”</p>
<p>Her response was “No, and I have already cleaned my room.”</p>
<p>I knew fully that her room in the current state would classify as a certified disaster zone. I then told her that these were not requests or options, but jobs that had to be done before she left with her friends on an activity they had planned for weeks. As teenagers can do, the more I stated my position and intent, the more resilient she became to follow any requests despite the consequences. Ultimately I think we both lost. She did not do her jobs and as a consequence was not allowed to go on the activity that she had looked forward to for a few weeks. I worry about her confidence and self-worth. Before leaving out of state today, I left her a note that said, “Even though we may disagree on things, it will not change how much I love you and how beautiful you are.” I hope she realizes that is how I feel about her. I hope and believe most parents feel the same about their children. Unfortunately, parental self-reflection after punishing a child takes an emotional toll and is often full of second-guessing.</p>
<p>As I sit on the plane, a question came to my mind. Do negative experiences, stresses, and lower self-worth in childhood impact risk of heart disease as adults? As I have discussed in my prior columns, <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/lose-temper-heart-health-risk/">life stressors and how we react to them</a> as adults <a href="//www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/stress-toxic-relationships-risk-factor-heart-disease-women/">greatly influence our heart health</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps these experiences and patterns of response are founded earlier in life when we are children and teenagers.</p>
<h2><strong>Adverse Childhood Experiences and Heart Disease</strong></h2>
<p>An interesting study was reported in the <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/13/208">journal BMC Pediatrics</a> and examined 1,234 children in grades six to eight. The authors collected information regarding blood pressure, body mass index, waist size, family education, and household income. Then they performed a survey to determine if 15 possible adverse childhood experiences possibly had occurred. The adverse experiences included abuse, household dysfunction, neglect, and mistreatment. Importantly, the children were asked if they perceived these events or others as causing persistent worry or unhappiness.</p>
<p>What they found was extraordinary. If the children had experienced four events that led to persistent worry or unhappiness, they were approximately two and a half times more likely to have an elevated heart rate, higher body mass index, and a large waist circumference (average of 3.6 cm more). Importantly, these findings were independent of their families income, education, and if it was a low-income or high-income school. In addition, those children with more adverse childhood experiences tended to have higher blood pressure, within the 95 percentile of age-matched peers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately obesity, waist circumference, and high blood pressure are the foundations of most of the heart disease in our country. This study teaches us that these risk factors can develop very early in life based upon a child’s environment, stresses, and responses to the stresses. It also teaches us that our child’s perceptions of stress are as important as the type of stresses.</p>
<h2><strong>The Influence of Family Environment on the Heart</strong></h2>
<p>A second interesting study dove more into the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2583078">impact of family environment and children’s responses to stress</a>. The study included 66 girls and 48 boys from an upper-middle class neighborhood in Pittsburgh. The children were analyzed by whether they came from an authoritarianism environment characterized by obedience to authority and less individual freedom, or a positive affiliation environment that was characterized by more intimate and personal relationships.</p>
<p>The author’s findings are helpful in understanding patterns of response to life stressors. In boys, more than girls, those that came from environments that were more authoritarian and less positive affiliation their hearts responded very differently to stress than those from other family environments. These children from more authoritarian homes had a very pronounced and elevated heart rate response during a series of questions and often displayed feelings of anger and hostility. These same responses in adulthood are associated with <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/lose-temper-heart-health-risk/">much higher rates of acute and chronic cardiac events</a>.</p>
<p>From this study we learn that the homes we create can influence how our children respond to stress both mentally and physically. These same responses, if favorable and positive, are likely going to promote heart health throughout their lives.</p>
<h2><strong>Can Parenting Style Make a Difference to Children’s Hearts?</strong></h2>
<p>A third study looked at childhood relationships with parents and adult <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/42/17149.abstract">biologic risks of heart disease</a>. The authors termed this heart risk the “allostatic load”. The allostatic load was comprised of 18 biomarkers known to impact heart health such as body inflammation, fat deposition, blood pressure, and others.</p>
<p>I believe the results of this study offered hope to parents that care for diverse children in all different environments. They looked at the long-term outcomes of 756 children. The children were classified as experiencing low, average, or high levels of childhood abuse and stress. The children were then compared by the child’s exposure to parental warmth. The children that had low childhood abuse and stress had in general a low adulthood allostatic load or heart risk. However, with average or high levels of abuse and stress those children that also had low or just average exposure to parental warmth had significantly higher adulthood allostatic loads.</p>
<p>What was remarkable to me in this study was those children that experienced high levels of parental warmth, their adult allostatic loads were identical across all levels of childhood abuses and stresses from low to high. Amazingly, the parent-child relationship can offset the many of the child stress experiences.</p>
<p>The lesson I learned from this study was parents can make a tremendous difference if they choose to create warm and supportive relationships with their children regardless of their child’s decisions and stresses.</p>
<h2><strong>Lesssons from the Heart Studies</strong></h2>
<p>These studies teach us that the stresses of our children are important risk factors for the adult heart disease and heart disease risk factors. Our children’s perception to the stress is important, even if the level of stress may not seem important. Persistent feelings or worry and unhappiness drive health risk. As parents we can create home environments that promote healthy responses to stresses that are largely inevitable in life. More importantly, as parents our relationships with our children can counteract a lot of the long-term consequences of these stresses. However, these latter two points take active and adaptive parenting.</p>
<p>This parenting advice is easier said than done. After researching this topic I hope to listen to my daughter more. I hope to be more patient and that she will be patient with me. To me, discipline is necessary for our children to respect the rules of our homes and society. However, after the discipline, I believe we have to make an extra effort to teach our children that they are loved and valued.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/do-parental-relationships-childhood-affect-heart-disease-risk/feed/0<title>Should We Screen for Heart Disease Before Athletics?</title>

Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=755Sudden deaths among young people who complete in athletics are terrible and tragic events. In the October 2014 issue of the journal JACC, many of the world experts in this area released a <a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1905085">consensus statement to provide guidelines</a> on when to screen for heart disease, in order to avoid this tragedy.<p>Fortunately, such events are rare. However, they are devastating and are often covered broadly in the news. Unfortunately, sudden death can occur at any time and often without warning even after years of athletic participation. As a parent of children participating in sports, these news reports occur too often and touch me on a personal level. I suspect they do most who read them.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865578898/After-brush-with-death-Utah-States-Danny-Berger-ready-to-serve-others.html?pg=all">knowing Danny Berger</a>. Danny came from a family of parents and siblings who all played college athletics. He grew up as an exceptional athlete and excelled at basketball. At over six feet six inches tall, he was highly recruited to play college basketball. He played at the collegiate level for two years and improved yearly in all phases of the game. He entered his junior year with anticipation to contribute significantly to a Utah State University (USU) basketball team that perennially wins over 20 games a year.</p>
<p>Then the unspeakable happened.</p>
<h2>An Unexpected, Sudden Collapse</h2>
<p>The USU basketball team was going through a walk-through practice before departing to play Brigham Young University that evening. During this walk-through practice session Danny suddenly collapsed. The USU trainer Mike Williams was prepared and had trained the staff for such an event. An <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/cpr-app-saving-lives-one-text-at-a-time/">automated external defibrillator (AED)</a> was immediately available courtside. The AED patches were placed on his chest and back within seconds. The AED immediately delivered a life-saving shock and restored Danny’s heart rhythm to normal. He recovered completely and resumed playing basketball from USU.</p>
<p>Danny has become a tremendous advocate for AEDs being available in all schools and athletic events. He was recognized for his outstanding service last year at the NCAA final four basketball tournament as part of an all-service team.</p>
<p>Danny had played at a very high level in basketball throughout his life. There were never any warning sings before the eventful day when the cardiac arrest occurred. Danny was fortunate; USU was prepared and delivered the necessary lifesaving AED therapy without delay or hesitation.</p>
<h2>When Screening Is Essential</h2>
<p>As parents or those who coach and teach young athletes, we face an important question. When should a person receive heart screening before they participate?</p>
<p>World experts released a <a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1905085">consensus statement to provide guidelines</a>. It would be nice to screen all kids in the United States with a basic cardiac test such as an electrocardiogram. This seems reasonable, until the scope of need is realized. In the United States this would include screening about 60 million young participants, including about 10 million competitive athletes. Unfortunately, for now, there is no nationwide screening program or approach. We need to rely on identifying people at risk based upon signs, symptoms, and their family history.</p>
<p>What are the signs and symptoms listed by the newly released guidelines that suggest the need for additional screening before active participation?</p>
<h2><strong>4 Symptoms That Mean Cardiac Screening Is Needed</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Chest pain/discomfort/tightness/pressure related to exertion</li>
<li>Unexplained passing out or near passing out</li>
<li>Shortness of breath or heart palpitations that seem out of proportion to the level of exercise performed</li>
<li>I would add personally, a prior seizure experienced with physical activity of any kind</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>4 Signs From a Prior Medical Exam</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Heart murmur</li>
<li>Elevated systemic blood pressure</li>
<li>Prior restriction from participation in sports</li>
<li>Prior testing for the heart of any kind, ordered by a physician</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>4 Concerning Family History Events</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Premature death (sudden and unexpected, or otherwise) before the age of 50 years suspicious to be related to heart disease in 1 or more relatives</li>
<li>Disability from heart disease in close relative less than 50 years of age</li>
<li>Hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, or other ion channelopathies, Marfan syndrome, or clinically significant arrhythmias; or any other <a href="http://www.sads.org/">sudden death syndrome</a>
</li>
<li>I would add, personally, a family history of drowning</li>
</ol>
<p>In my opinion, if you are unsure if your child has experienced these symptoms or if you are unclear about the significance of your family history, it is better to discuss this with your physician before your child starts to participate in high-level to elite-level athletic competition.</p>
<h2>Having an AED Onsite Saves Lives</h2>
<p>However, as a parent, coach, principle, or youth sports leader another part of Danny’s story remains very relevant and important.</p>
<p>Danny is alive today because USU had <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/things-you-need-to-know-about-aeds.aspx">an AED immediately available</a>. It is not excusable, in my opinion, for any school to not have an AED. It is not excusable for these schools not to have a program to make sure the AED is functional, supplied, and the battery is active, and their staff is trained to use the device. It is not excusable to not have <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/hear-me-out/is-your-retailer-prepared-for-your-sudden-cardiac-arrest/">an AED immediately available</a> for sporting events that occur under their supervision or on their property. I mention “school” broadly; consider this same approach to safe guard these young participants that are involved on club teams, traveling teams, all-star teams, etc.</p>
<p>With cardiac arrest, mortality goes up by 10 percent for each minute that passes. If it takes three to four minutes to get an AED and then another minute to connect it to the person, many lives will be lost unnecessarily. Before you allow your child to participate in any sport, make sure that these conditions with an AED and training are met. As a parent or coach, make sure you know where the AED is located.</p>
<p>Fortunately, youth deaths during sports are relatively rare. The death rate from sports trails behind deaths from motor vehicle accidents, suicides, cancers, infections, and accidental firearm discharges. Fortunately, many of the sports-related cardiac deaths are preventable if at risk participants are first screened and AEDs are immediately available at all the events. Screening is not enough. Danny’s heart screening would have been normal. An AED still needs to be available even if the participants all seem healthy, have competed before, and don’t have high-risk signs or symptoms.</p>
<p>I do wish to make a plea to parents and community leaders, that you contact the principles in your area and make sure that all schools from elementary to high school have an AED available. If they do not, find ways to help supply these life saving devices to our schools through local advocacy and sponsorship.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/should-we-screen-heart-disease-before-athletics/feed/0<title>How to Stay Young at Heart and Keep Your Blood Pressure Low</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/how-remain-young-heart-maintain-low-blood-pressure/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/how-remain-young-heart-maintain-low-blood-pressure/#commentsThu, 18 Sep 2014 20:40:06 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=738Of all the causes of atrial fibrillation that I see in my clinic each week, <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/high-blood-pressure-young-adults-linked-developing-dementia/">high blood pressure</a>, obesity, and <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/a-careful-look-into-insomnia-an-all-too-common-silent-killer/">sleep apnea</a> are the most common. I am seeing high blood pressure and sleep apnea now in very young patients. As a consequence, I also see atrial fibrillation in very young patients.<p>For example, a few weeks ago I met with a person who developed high blood pressure and sleep apnea in his teens and atrial fibrillation in his very early twenties. Most of the time, I talk about the importance of treating and preventing the progression of all the problems. When it comes to high blood pressure in young people, I very often receive a response such as, “Give me six months to see what I can do, to get my life in order.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the vast majority of people I see six months later, the blood pressure remains high and the other health problems also remain. At that appointment I don’t ask why they did not do anything to reduce their blood pressure, but instead we focus on what can be done. With all medical problems, you have to keep a certain level of optimism. Just like diets or  efforts to stop addictions, all lifestyle changes can be hard and you’ll often find that there are good times and bad times.</p>
<p>This week, two new studies published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology drive home the point that high blood pressure is a very serious disease, and preventing it or treating it early is essential.</p>
<h2><b>How Waiting to Treat Blood Pressure Affects Your Future</b></h2>
<p>As our world has become more industrialized, a blood pressure trend has become apparent. As we age our blood pressure increases. In a large American study, called <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23108660">the Framingham Heart Study</a>, systolic blood pressure (the top part of the blood pressure measurement) starts to increase at the age of 30 and continues throughout life. Diastolic blood pressure (the bottom part of the blood pressure measurement) starts to also increase at 30 through mid-life and then tends to stay the same or decline slightly. This is an important concept to recognize.</p>
<p>Most of the patients I meet and talk to about blood pressure tell me they have never had blood pressure problems. However, the fact that risk goes up each year we age accounts for why blood pressure problems are common as we get older. One important point to make about this observation is it does not necessarily have to happen. In many non-industrialized parts to the world, blood pressure does not rise with age. This is important to recognize because daily choices that stem from where we live and what we do influence our blood pressure over our lifetime.</p>
<h2>How Blood Pressure Changes Over the Years</h2>
<p>In the first study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, <a href="Effects%20of%20cardiorespiratory%20fitness%20on%20blood%20pressure%20trajectory%20with%20aging%20in%20a%20cohort%20of%20healthly%20men.%20">Dr. Liu and colleagues</a> from the University of South Carolina looked at blood pressure trajectories in our country. Basically, if you start out with a blood pressure at 30 years of age, what is it likely to be at 70? Then they asked the question, what could be done to lower your trajectory or result in a lower blood pressure when you are older? To answer this question they studied, 13,953 healthy men who participated in preventive medical examinations from 1970 to 2006. In addition to a number of tests, these men underwent treadmill testing to determine their level of fitness level compared to the general population. They were classified as low (less than 33 percentile), moderate (33 to 66 percentile), and high (greater than 66 percentile) fitness levels.</p>
<p>The researchers found that those patients in the high fitness classification had a lower blood pressure to begin with and their trajectory throughout their lifetime was lower. For example, a low-fitness level person had a systolic blood pressure of 110 at age 20 that was projected to be between 130 and 135 at 80. A high-fitness level person who had a systolic blood pressure of 106 at age 20 was projected to have a systolic pressure between 120 and 125 at 80. More importantly, the favorable impact of fitness remained across all body fat percentages, blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and those who drank alcohol. It even held up in those with a strong family history of high blood pressure. For blood pressure, then, it is not all in your genes: Your choices significantly impact your risk.</p>
<p>To answer the first question, if you are not serious about your blood pressure early in life or when you first notice a problem, it will become more difficult to treat later on.</p>
<h2><b>How Does Your Fitness Level Stack Up?</b></h2>
<p>Only about 20 to 30 percent of Americans meet <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html">CDC guidelines for aerobic and strength activity</a>.  If you are meeting these, you are above the 66th percentile for fitness.</p>
<p>Here are the guidelines for activity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do two hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week, including two or more days that you work on strength training of the major muscle groups (legs, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
<li>Or do two hours and 15 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity every week, including two or more days that you work on strength training of the major muscle groups (legs, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
</ol>
<p>One recommendation to note is the importance of strength training. Most of my patients start by <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/where-are-all-the-men-in-the-gym-and-what-does-scotland-have-to-do-with-it/">walking, jogging, or using an elliptical machine</a>. Often this results in a frustrating plateau of success regarding weight loss and blood pressure lowering at some point. Adding strength training can minimize this plateauing effect.</p>
<h2><b>If You Are Older, Should You Cut Down on Exercise?</b></h2>
<p>The CDC guidelines tell us to do exactly the opposite. As people get <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/older-obese-women-can-still-protect-their-heart/">older there is a greater benefit  with more exercise</a>. If you are over 50, consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Five hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week, including two or more days that you work on strength training of the major muscle groups (legs, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
<li>Or two hours and 30 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity every week, including two or more days that you work on strength training of the major muscle groups (legs, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>You Can Stay Young at Heart</b></h2>
<p>As <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/walk-in-2014-as-if-your-life-depended-on-it/">we exercise and work our muscles</a>, they become more efficient and strong. They also get bigger and thicker. High blood pressure is a continuous workload on the heart. During 100,000 or more beats per day in most of us, the heart has to work to move the blood forward against blood pressure. Unlike our skeletal muscles in our arms and legs, we don’t want our heart to get thick from working against too much of a load. A thick heart can’t open up quickly to accept returning blood. The faster your heart rate becomes, the less efficient a thick heart performs and you develop early fatigue, shortness of breath, and at times dizziness and edema.</p>
<p>The second study looked at the heart over time, in particular how thick it was and if it had started to stiffen. As the heart thickens and stiffens, the upper heart chambers swell in size. Atrial fibrillation and strokes can develop, as well as heart failure symptoms.</p>
<p><span>A team led by </span><a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1905445">Dr. Paul Bhella and Benjamin Levine</a><span> from the University of Texas-Southwestern Medical center studied 102 healthy seniors to look at lifestyle patterns and heart function. They separated these seniors into four groups of lifetime activity:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>sedentary (fewer than two exercise sessions per week)</span></li>
<li><span>casual (two to three exercise sessions per week)</span></li>
<li><span>committed (four to five sessions per week)</span></li>
<li><span>competitive (six to seven exercise sessions per week)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>What they found was in those who had developed a lifelong pattern of committed or competitive exercise habits, the heart did not stiffen with age or thicken. The heart remained functionally like it was when they were younger.</p>
<p>Many of my elderly patients say it is difficult to get around and that they are stiffer than they use to be. The good news is that your heart does not have to be.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/how-remain-young-heart-maintain-low-blood-pressure/feed/0<title>Low-Fat or Low-Carbohydrate Diet: What’s Best for Your Heart?</title>
<link>http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/low-fat-low-carbohydrate-whats-best-for-your-heart/		http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/low-fat-low-carbohydrate-whats-best-for-your-heart/#commentsThu, 04 Sep 2014 18:45:31 +0000T. Jared Bunch, MDhttp://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/?p=720Recently I met with a patient who was in his early thirties. He had been treated for high blood pressure for almost a decade. He came to me because he was in <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/will-my-atrial-fibrillation-get-worse-how-to-reduce-your-risk/">atrial fibrillation</a> and felt short of breath and noticed his heart was racing.<p>We talked about his abnormal heart rhythm and that he was developing diseases that we typically see in older adults. I asked if his family also had abnormal heart rhythms or problems with their blood pressure. He said yes, but with each generation the problems were coming earlier. When I asked him why he thought this was happening, he said that everybody in his family struggles to maintain their weight and he was the biggest of all.</p>
<p>He also said, “I am going to start on a diet and exercise.”</p>
<p>His wife said, “I am going to write that down and hold you to it.”</p>
<p>He then said, “I am committed. What diet is the best for me?”</p>
<h2>Comparing Diets for Heart Health</h2>
<p>I recently wrote about <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/diets-to-prevent-coronary-heart-disease-1957-2013-lessons-learned-and-which-to-use/">50 years of diets to prevent heart disease</a>. With these diet studies we learned that low-fat diets alone are not that helpful in preventing heart disease. A diet approach that is balanced is often optimal for long-term compliance and use.</p>
<p>Recently, low-carbohydrate, or low-carb, diets have become very popular. In regular diets we consume a lot of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are abundant in potatoes, breads, pastas, cereals, some dried fruits, and of course candies and sweets. In low-carb diets, these carbohydrate dense foods are replaced with low-carbohydrate foods such as apples, carrots, lentils, etc. In some diets, low-carbohydrate foods are replaced by protein-dense foods such as meats. As I discussed in my prior column about diets, low fat diets simply try to reduce total intake of daily fat to a certain percentage of the total diet (often less than 30 percent).</p>
<p>If you are looking to take something out of your diet, should it be the carbohydrates or the fats?</p>
<h2>New Research on Low-Fat Vs. Low-Carbohydrate Diets</h2>
<p>A recent study examined this very question as it relates to long-term heart health. In a large study from Tulane University, Kaiser Permanente, and Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, 148 people without heart disease were recruited to participate in either a low fat or low carb diet to see if<a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1900694"> choice of diet reduced heart disease risk</a>. These patients met individually with a dietitian weekly for the first four weeks and then in small group meetings every other week for the next five months. Then they participated in monthly sessions for six more months. The intensity of diet training highlights the challenges of staying on a diet long-term, and how working with others and as a team often helps you make it and stay compliant.</p>
<p>In this study, a low-carb diet was defined as one with fewer than 40 carbohydrate grams per day. When calculating your carbohydrate consumption, you need to take your total carbohydrates and subtract those carbs you’re getting  from fiber.</p>
<p>The low-fat diet was defined as having fewer than 30 percent of  daily calories from total fat (with less than 7 percent from saturated fat) and 55 percent from carbohydrates.</p>
<p>A diet is no easy matter and takes preparation. You have to be organized and create food lists, learn to read nutritional panels, make detailed shopping lists, take time to cook, and create a diverse menu. Getting some of this type of information is one of the greatest benefits of meeting with a dietician who can help you plan your diet and with subsequent meetings help you stay on track. In this study, a handbook that contained this kind of information was given to all participants.</p>
<h2>Weight-Loss Results</h2>
<p>The results of maintaining a diet were profound. At one year, participants had lost an average of 8 pounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the low-fat group, the average weight loss was 4 pounds.</li>
<li>In the low-carb group, the average weight loss was much greater, at nearly 12 pounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding waist circumference, the low-fat group’s average loss was 5.0 centimeters (about 2 inches) whereas the loss in the low-carb group was greater, at 6.7 centimeters (over 2.5 inches).</p>
<p>In addition, for people in the low-carb diet group, the amount of body weight from lean mass compared to fat mass improved. In the low-fat diet group, these changes were not observed.</p>
<p>Markers of heart health, like cholesterol and blood pressure, also changed. In both groups there was a decrease in cholesterol and blood pressure. Blood sugar levels were lower in the low-fat group, whereas body inflammation markers were lower in the low-carb group.</p>
<p>In both groups, nearly all patients stayed on their diet for the year. In both groups, the level of physical activity was similar, so this really became a study of diets, not exercise.</p>
<h2>Heart-Protective Benefits of the Low-Carb Diet</h2>
<p>What the authors found was that the low-fat diet, although helpful in weight loss, did not reduce risk of heart disease. In contrast, with the low-carb diet, the 10-year risk of heart disease was reduced by 1.4 percent on average. This number may not seem that high, but in a 30-year-old person who I hope lives another 40 to 50 years, the cumulative effects of diet choice can be seen, with risk reductions ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.</p>
<p>What did this study teach us?</p>
<ol>
<li>A low-carb diet is better than a low-fat diet, if you want to lose more weight and reduce your waist circumference.</li>
<li>If you have heart disease in your family, a low-carb diet is likely a better choice as it can reduce risk over time. The low-fat diets alone do not appear to reduce risk.</li>
<li>If you have elevated markers of inflammation in your blood tests, diet choice may help reduce these.</li>
<li>Finally, maintaining a diet is hard and takes a lot of work and frequent follow-up.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe the effort involved in a diet is worth it. I also believe that if my patient chooses lifestyle changes, begins to lose weight, and makes healthy diet choices, we can <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/the-best-treatment-for-atrial-fibrillation-is-to-prevent-it/">reduce his risk of atrial fibrillation progression</a>, and he may at some time in the future no longer have to use medications for either his blood pressure or his abnormal heart rhythm.</p>]]&gt;http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/jared-bunch-rhythm-of-life/low-fat-low-carbohydrate-whats-best-for-your-heart/feed/0</body></html>
